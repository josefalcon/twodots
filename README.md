# twodots

This is a Javacsript implementation of the basic functionality of the game [TwoDots][1].
It is not intended to be a full implementation of the game, but a practice in writing Javascript.

Try it out [here][2]!

## Build

```sh
npm install
node index.js
```

Navigate to [http://localhost:8080] to access the game in your browser. Use
`npm run watch` to automatically build and bundle your development changes.
`npm run bundle` will bundle and uglify a Javascript file to `static/js/bundle.js`.
